This is the source code for the learnscripture.net Android app  - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.learnscripture.webviewapp

It is a simple app that just views http://learnscripture.net/ in a WebView, along with some tweaks to add menus and make the back button work better with respect to modal dialogs etc.

The source code for the website itself is at https://bitbucket.org/spookylukey/learnscripture.net
